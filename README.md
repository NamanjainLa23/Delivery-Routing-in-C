# Delivery-Routing-in-C
E-commerce delivery routing System using Algorithms and Data Structures in C language

This project aims to calculate optimal path (least travelling cost) between the different nodes that a delivery executive needs to travel in order to save time and money. This optimal path is chosen by considering the distance between every nodes where product is to be delivered.

Traffic and other measures are not encountered as of now.

Project reports and Source codes along with outputs are attached in the project

Two approaches are used for calculating the optimal path(route)
  1.Brute Force
  2.Dynamic Programming

Algorithms used for Travelling Saleman Problem is Bellman-Held-Karp Algorithm for Dynamic programming
By using brute force approach we can actually understand the importance of the problem as it provides an insight of the extra cost that saleman needs to incur if he takes non-optimal path.
