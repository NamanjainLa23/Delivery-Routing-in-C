# Delivery-Routing-in-C
E-commerce delivery routing System using Algorithms and Data Structures in C language

This project aims to calculate optimal path (least travelling cost) between the different nodes that a delivery executive needs to travel in order to save time and money. This optimal path is chosen by considering the distance between every nodes where product is to be delivered.

Traffic and other measures are not encountered as of now.

Project reports and Source codes along with outputs are attached in the project
